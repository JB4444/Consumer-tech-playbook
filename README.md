# 🛠️ Consumer Tech Playbook

Welcome to the **Consumer Tech Playbook** — a collection of free demos, resources, and starter projects that help you level up from *maker* to *engineer*.

This repo is your **entry point into the world of product engineering**: mechanical (ME), electrical (EE), and firmware (FW).  
Whether you’re a student, a hobbyist, or an early-career engineer, you’ll find practical examples here that mirror real-world consumer tech projects.

## 📂 What’s Inside
- **Demo Projects**  
  Quick, standalone examples you can explore right away:
  - `SolidWorks_Demo_PhoneCase/` → CAD + STL for a simple snap-fit phone case.
  - `Altium_Demo_LED_Board/` → schematic + PCB + Gerbers for a blinking LED board.
  - `Arduino_Demo_BlinkToSerial/` → firmware + breadboard diagram for Arduino.

- **Mini Resources**  
  Handy references you can use in your projects:
  - `BOM_Template.xlsx` — starter Bill of Materials for PCB projects.
  - `Tolerance_Stackup_Example.pdf` — simple example of mechanical fit analysis.
  - `Oscilloscope_QuickStart.pdf` — first 5 things to do with your scope.

- **Docs**  
  Short tutorials to get you moving fast:
  - `docs/Intro_to_3D_Printing.md`
  - `docs/PCB_Fabrication_Basics.md`
  - `docs/Firmware_Debugging_101.md`
