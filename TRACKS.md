# 📚 Consumer Tech Learning Tracks

This is the **core roadmap** of the Consumer Tech Playbook.  
Each track (ME, EE, FW) has two parts:
- **Learning**: foundational skills, explained step-by-step.  
- **Projects**: hands-on builds that mirror real consumer tech products.  

---

## 🏗️ Mechanical Engineering (ME)
- CAD with SolidWorks  
- 3D printing + manufacturing design  
- Simulation & tolerance analysis  
👉 [Explore the ME Track](ME.md)

---

## ⚡ Electrical Engineering (EE)
- Circuit design fundamentals  
- Schematic + PCB layout in Altium  
- Debugging with multimeter & oscilloscope  
👉 [Explore the EE Track](EE.md)

---

## 💻 Firmware (FW)
- Arduino fundamentals → embedded C  
- Communication protocols (UART, I2C, SPI)  
- Real-world consumer device firmware  
👉 [Explore the FW Track](FW.md)
